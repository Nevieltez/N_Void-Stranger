# Void Stranger_Notes

My notes are all around the place... One day I will add all of them here... Or so I plan to do it if I can figure out a good way to do it...

For now, if you just stumbled here out of curiousity, I would advise you don't read further. Major-super-ultra-mega-spoilers as some would say.

I wanted to share my notes and understanding of the Brunout clear for Cif's battle. For now it's just copy pasted from my other file, and I moved it to another file which would be [[burnout.md]].
