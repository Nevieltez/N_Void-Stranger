# Cif Fight

Insanely annoying. My hand is a bit stiff from continuously pressing the key pad. I miss keystrokes because of the fatigue. A very easy counter. Make a 2 block platform in the bottom and you can easily dodge it.

I think the problem with me is I'm not focusing around my player.

## Attacks - Phase 1

I ordered them in terms of their predictability. Simplest ones are the ones that can be predictably dodged. Which is technically all of them, but some require more concentration.

### 1. Hexagon Trail

Move off the grid.
Fun Fact: you can move off the grid at the top and hit her while the hexagons are going by. If you want to be efficient.

### 2. Crescent Rings

Move off the grid around the middle.

### 3. Shooting Stars

Look out for the trails and avoid them.

### 4. Hexagon Spiral

Has 2 spawn locations. Higher or Lower. If it's higher you can stay in the middle 3x1 or top 1x1. If it's lower you can move to either top or bottom 3x1s.

### 5. Star Burst

Don't stay in the 2x2 with stars. A very easy attack.to dodge (if you don't panic).

### 6. Hexagon Blast

Move quickly and avoid it. Move away and shift lanes based on where the blast occurred.
Very tricky to dodge on a 3x3. Take one turn away from the blast point like a hose in chess. And once they start spreading move left or right.

### 7. Sword Shower

Look for the one that spawns the last and go under it. And move out once it starts falling. Then just move around. Key point to note: you don't have to keep moving to dodge the palms, they take like around a second to pop, so just move slowly focusing on the zapping beam trails.

### 8. Spinning blades

They start moving based on the spawn pattern of their walls. Lure 1 and 2 to one direction and then 3 and 4 to the other one. 1 and 2 move almost together, 3 takes a little while and 4 follows with a delay too.

### 9. Spinning Swords

Stay in the line of the most delayed one and then move to the earliest one.
Or Just dodge them and move up and down.

### 10. Burst Shooting

Has 2 variants. Just move lol. Preferably horizontally.

### 11. Palm Blades

Watch for the blinking palm and then take a U turn. Watch out for the blades and repeat.

### 12. Switch Blades

You can stay on the bottom row and dodge it by moving horizontally. Or do a zig zag against the current to get through it. I recommend trying to use both if you can't move horizontally, otherwise just move horizontally and move through it.
Fun fact, the outer rings have a slight gap between them, you can squish through it if you're feeling daring.

### 13. Ping Pong

Balls move according to the spawn pattern of the walls. Last one will target your position. This used to be the hardest of all attacks until I figured out placing two tiles at the bottom. Look for the last spawner and hover over to that edge. Look at the spawner, and as soon the balls hit it move the other direction. This is especially important if the last one is on either bottom left or right (second video). You have very little time to dodge it.

### 14. Machine Gun

Couldn't come up with a better name. Move towards the open area, as far as you can until the balls are shot. And then immediately start moving towards the other direction.
![[14_3x3.mp4]]

### 15. Ball Shower

Happens once you've hit her 14 times and haven't made the 16th hit yet. Or happens when you've been on the field too long. Not entirely sure. Lasts for a full attack duration and then goes away.

### Attacks - Phase 2

Not sure if all of phase 1 attacks are in phase 2. But it's just phase 1 attack but absurdly fast and tricky.

### Attacks - Phase 3

Man. The fucking excitement at the last phase is incredible

### The Square

### Rockets

They seem to drop on the 3x3 based on players position. As soon as you see the first rocket target, move out of the way and up/down depending on square. Best be quick or else you're toast.
Jump over 3 Lines and move out of the way. Repeat 3 times and you're on the next phase.

### Hexagons #1

Go through them

### Hexagons #2

And go through them

### Black Screen

The squares get fast. then they get slow. And finally the screen goes black.
I think You have to jump 3 times when the screen has gone black. With the rythmn of the black lines.

You have to jump 2 times after the screen goes black. You can see the first of those right before the screen goes black, the next one you have to time it and jump at a second mark.
