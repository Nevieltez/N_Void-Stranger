# I hope you know what you're doing here

I took these notes to contextulize the muscle memory I built doing my attempts, and make it a bit logical instead of just "instinct".

This battle was a lot of ~~fun~~, and highly recommend everyone to do it.

Fun as in my wrist started to hurt from mashing the arrow keys for hours, my ring finger went stiff a few times as well. Primarily because my arm was positioned a bit awkwardly on the arrow keys... I noticied it in time and saved myself from carple tunnel.
I have a few general tips for this battle, and then specific tips on each attacks. I recommend considering the general tips before going into attack tips. You'd miss out on the fun of the attacks if you just read about the attacks instead of experiencing them. That being said, if you're not determined to do it all by yourself, or have a day job like most of us, I'd recommend at least attempting the battle for at least an hour before you go on and read the tips on attacks. Explaining what I was doing last weekend to my collegues was the hardest thing ever, it's a weird obsession.

## General Tips

- Make sure your hand position is not awkward and doesn't cause pain.
- Pay attention to the spawn order of attacks, their position, and order.
- Pay attention to the position of attacks, and their behavior. All attacks are perdictable.
- Make sure to take break. I never followed this one, but I do highly recommend it.

## Attacks

Well, I do think reading these would be a spoiler if you don't have fun failing at the boss for a while.
Becuase the struggle and pain is what makes the reward worth it.

With that being said, it will save you a lot of time in trying to figure out the little things that, well, took me a lot of while to get used to. And, as they say, practice makes perfect. It's still a tricky battle, and I wish you best of luck >:)
