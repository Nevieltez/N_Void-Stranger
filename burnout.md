# I hope you know what you're doing here

I took these notes to contextulize the muscle memory I built doing my attempts, and make it a bit logical instead of just "instinct".

This battle was a lot of ~~fun~~, and highly recommend everyone to do it.

Fun as in my wrist started to hurt from mashing the arrow keys for hours, my ring finger went stiff a few times as well. Primarily because my arm was positioned a bit awkwardly on the arrow keys... I noticied it in time and saved myself from carple tunnel.
I have a few general tips for this battle, and then specific tips on each attacks. I recommend considering the general tips before going into attack tips. You'd miss out on the fun of the attacks if you just read about the attacks instead of experiencing them. That being said, if you're not determined to do it all by yourself, or have a day job like most of us, I'd recommend at least attempting the battle for at least an hour before you go on and read the tips on attacks. Explaining what I was doing last weekend to my collegues was the hardest thing ever, it's a weird obsession.

## General Tips

- Make sure your hand position is not awkward and doesn't cause pain.
- Pay attention to the spawn order of attacks, their position, and order.
- Pay attention to the position of attacks, and their behavior. All attacks are perdictable.
- Make sure to take break. I never followed this one, but I do highly recommend it.

## Attacks

Well, I do think reading these would be a spoiler if you don't have fun failing at the boss for a while.
Becuase the struggle and pain is what makes the reward worth it.

Wite that being said, it will save you a lot of time in trying to figure out the little things that, well, took me a lot of while to get used to. And, as they say, practice makes perfect. It's still a tricky battle, and I wish you best of luck >:)

Oh and I came up with names for every attack as well.

### Phase 1

These attacks are ranked from easy to hard. Mainly based on how hard I found them, but objectively they are based on their perdictability and how movements required to dodge them.
Oh and a fun fact, every attack can be dodged on a 3x3. Or well, all but two of them. But everything can be solved with the paw platform...

I couldn't embed videos on this page, so I added gifs before. The videos can be found here at this [imgur collection](https://imgur.com/a/J9gS0UP).

I ordered them in terms of their predictability. Simplest ones are the ones that can be predictably dodged. Which is technically all of them, but some require more concentration.

#### 1. Hexagon Trail

Move off the grid.
Fun Fact: you can move off the grid at the top and hit her while the hexagons are going by. If you want to be efficient.
3x3

#### 2. Crescent Rings

Move off the grid around the middle.

#### 3. Shooting Stars

Look out for the trails and avoid them.
3x3

#### 4. Hexagon Spiral

Has 2 spawn locations. Higher or Lower. If it's higher you can stay in the middle 3x1 or top 1x1. If it's lower you can move to either top or bottom 3x1s.

#### 5. Star Burst

Don't stay in the 2x2 with stars. A very easy attack.to dodge (if you don't panic).

#### 6. Hexagon Blast

Move quickly and avoid it. Move away and shift lanes based on where the blast occurred.
Very tricky to dodge on a 3x3. Take one turn away from the blast point like a hose in chess. And once they start spreading move left or right.

#### 7. Sword Shower

Look for the one that spawns the last and go under it. And move out once it starts falling. Then just move around. Key point to note: you don't have to keep moving to dodge the palms, they take like around a second to pop, so just move slowly focusing on the zapping beam trails.
3x3

#### 8. Spinning blades

They start moving based on the spawn pattern of their walls. Lure 1 and 2 to one direction and then 3 and 4 to the other one. 1 and 2 move almost together, 3 takes a little while and 4 follows with a delay too.

#### 9. Spinning Swords

Stay in the line of the most delayed one and then move to the earliest one.
Or Just dodge them and move up and down.

#### 10. Burst Shooting

Has 2 variants. Just move lol. Preferably horizontally.

#### 11. Palm Blades

Watch for the blinking palm and then take a U turn. Watch out for the blades and repeat.

#### 12. Switch Blades

You can stay on the bottom row and dodge it by moving horizontally. Or do a zig zag against the current to get through it. I recommend trying to use both if you can't move horizontally, otherwise just move horizontally and move through it.
Fun fact, the outer rings have a slight gap between them, you can squish through it if you're feeling daring.
3x3

#### 13. Ping Pong

Balls move according to the spawn pattern of the walls. Last one will target your position. This used to be the hardest of all attacks until I figured out placing two tiles at the bottom. Look for the last spawner and hover over to that edge. Look at the spawner, and as soon the balls hit it move the other direction. This is especially important if the last one is on either bottom left or right (second video). You have very little time to dodge it.

#### 14. Machine Gun

Couldn't come up with a better name. Move towards the open area, as far as you can until the balls are shot. And then immediately start moving towards the other direction.
![[14_3x3.mp4]]

#### 15. Ball Shower

Happens once you've hit her 14 times and haven't made the 16th hit yet. Or happens when you've been on the field too long. Not entirely sure. Lasts for a full attack duration and then goes away.
